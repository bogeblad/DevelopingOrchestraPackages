# Background

The packaging initiative run Q1/Q2 2017 was an effort to find if and how we could scale our business by offering more packaged offerings and reuse more of what we have done in the regions. A lot of package candidates as well as reusable technical components were identified but it also became clear that the gap between a local solution and a globally supported solution was substantial. There analysis also clearly showed that packaged offerings without a technical solution backing it would result in much less value.

To achieve good efficiency in operations a package system was created to store packages and a new application was launched called the "Orchestra Provisioning tool".

## Solution overview

We have created a global repository, where all packages are made available. The provisioning tool then acts as the delivery mechanism between this global repository and the Orchestra system targetet for the package.

The tool is typically run by a configuration analyst which is responsible for setting up the solution and by using this we can cut deployment time from hours/days to minutes.
